# guess-my-number
 A small web application that I built in order to practice JavaScript, mainly DOM manipulation. It's  It is a game where the user needs to guess a number between 1 and 20. It has a scoring and highscore system, sound effects (which can be disabled) and its fully responsive.  Deployed on github pages: https://athosfranco.github.io/guess-my-number/
 
 
I built this app as an exercise in the DOM manipulation module of the course "The Complete JavaScript Course - from Zero to Mastery" by Jonas Schmedtmann.
